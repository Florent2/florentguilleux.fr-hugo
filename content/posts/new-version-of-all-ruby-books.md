title = "New version of All Ruby Books"

+++

I have pushed a new version of the [All Ruby Books](http://www.allrubybooks.com) website. It lists all the books about the Ruby programming language I could find.

This is now a static website so it should be faster.

I have updated the content so it should be pretty up to date.

The data is stored in JSON format in [the ruby-books GitHub repository](https://github.com/Florent2/ruby-books). It means anyone can contribute to the list, by adding new books or fixing wrong info.
