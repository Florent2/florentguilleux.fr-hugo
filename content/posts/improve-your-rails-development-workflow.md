Here the slides of a presentation I gave for the [Ruby Peru](http://ruby.pe) group on March 26, 2011: [Improve Your Rails Development Workflow](https://speakerdeck.com/florent2/improve-your-rails-development-workflow).

Itâ€™s about gems and plugins I use to ease the development of my Rails applications, not processes or programming techniques.
