The RubyGems feed and Twitter stream do not distinguish between new gems and updated gems, and announce each new version of a gem.

It was hard for me to follow. Thatâ€™s why I created [Gems Summary](http://gems-summary.heroku.com/). It generates everyday a feed post listing separately the new gems released on RubyGems and the updated gems. If a gem is updated several times during a single day, it is mentioned only once in the post.

The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Florent2/gems-summary).
