I presented an introduction about handling requests in parallel in Rails applications during the [Ruby Peru](http://ruby.pe/) meeting of August 2013.

If you want to know more I highly recommend the book [Working With Ruby Threads](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-ruby-threads), from Jesse Storimer.

Here are the slides:
